Kill the JT9 process and restart WSTJ-X

Sometimes when running WSJT-X, something will happen and the application will crash but leave jt9.exe running in the background. I would restart WSJT-X, only to be told that jt9 was running. 

I wrote this powershell script to automatically kill jt9 if it's running and then restart wsjt-x

All with the help of our overlords (AI).
